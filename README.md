# Sentify

## At-A-Glance

**Problem:** As an avid music lover, I'm constantly looking for new music to add to my various playlists. Although Spotify has by far the best recommendation system when compared to other music streaming platforms (in my opinion), there few options to get on-demand new music recommendations. The main way, outside of album releases, I find music is through either Spotify's "Discover Weekly" or "Daily Mix" playlists.

**Solution:** A web application that generates a Spotify playlist of up to 100 songs based on your top artists/tracks of a given time period. I added the sentiment analysis feature, because at the time I had the idea for this project I recently completed an intership which focus heavily on sentiment analysis and wanted to play around with its use.
